Replace the default mouse cursor with a custom image using a simple settings page.

== Description ==

**Custom Cursor Plugin** allows you to replace the default browser mouse cursor with a custom PNG or SVG image on the frontend of your website.

The plugin is lightweight, easy to configure, and uses WordPress’s native Media Uploader for selecting cursor images. It is ideal for creative websites, portfolios, landing pages, and modern UI designs.

The custom cursor follows the mouse smoothly using optimized JavaScript for best performance.
